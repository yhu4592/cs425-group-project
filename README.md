Run program using `python main.py` from this directory

To initialize database with sample data (or to reset it), enter "init" for username and then restart program

There are 3 provided users:
	Username					Password
	"administrator"		11111
	"manager"					22222
	"employee"				33333

Employees must also enter their SSN. Existing SSNs (with sample data) are 111111111, 222222222, 333333333, 444444444, 555555555

All available actions will be displayed in the console. Enter the corresponding number for the desired action and press enter.
Fill out data fields if necessary. Note that some data fields must match existing database contents (e.g. foreign keys) and some data fields have type enforcement (e.g. numbers)

For Managers and Employees to access data from certain reports (paychecks), they must first be generated by an administrator, or they will encounter errors.
